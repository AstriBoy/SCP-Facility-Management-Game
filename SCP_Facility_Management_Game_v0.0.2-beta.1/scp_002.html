            Element #: SCP-002

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-002 is to be connected to a power source at all times, to remain in what appears to be its charging mode. In the event of a power outage, the area is to be immediately evacuated and the emergency barrier separating the object from the rest of the building is to be activated. Upon restoration of power, SCP-002's containment chamber is to be flooded with alternating X-ray and ultraviolet light until the object is reconnected to a power source and returns to charging mode. The containment area is to be maintained under negative pressure at all times.

Teams of at least two members are to remain within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel are to maintain physical contact with one another at all times to ensure the other person is actually present, as the object may affect perception of the surrounding environment.

Only Level 3 personnel or higher are permitted to access SCP-002; this restriction may be lifted with written authorization from at least two Level 4 off-site administrators. Personnel with such authorization must still be escorted by at least five Level 3 security personnel for the duration of their contact with SCP-002, and must temporarily relinquish their rank and security clearance. Once the visit is complete, the personnel in question will be escorted at least 5 km away from SCP-002 to undergo a seventy-two hour quarantine and psychological evaluation. If no problems arise, the aforementioned personnel will regain their rank and security clearance.

Description: SCP-002 resembles a fleshy tumorous growth with a volume of approximately 60 m3 . An iron door located on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-cost apartment of modest size. One of the walls of the room has a window, although no opening is visible from the outside. The room contains several items of furniture which, upon closer inspection, are revealed to be bone sculptures, braided hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All tests performed so far show that each item in the room has either different or fragmentary DNA.

See the Mulhausen Report [cross-ref:document00.023.603] for further details pertaining to the initial discovery of the object.

Report: To date, the object is believed to be responsible for the disappearance of seven personnel. In addition, since its entry into Foundation custody, the object has acquired two lamps, a rug, a television, a radio, a bean bag, three books written in an unknown language, four children's toys, and a small potted plant. All tests using multiple laboratory animals, including primates, have failed to elicit any response from SCP-002, as have corpses. Whatever process the object uses to convert organic matter into furniture, it appears to be capable of occurring only in the presence of a living human.
